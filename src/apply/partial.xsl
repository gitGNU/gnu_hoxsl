<!--
  Partially apply dynamic function reference FNREF

  When provided to `f:apply', FNREF will be applied with ARGS as its
  beginning argments, followed by any arguments to `f:apply'.

  Note that you usually do not have to invoke this function directly:
  the dynamic function calls will handle currying/partial application
  for you, which has a much more inviting syntax.

  TODO: Accept partial application as FNREF.

<function name="f:partial">
  <param name="fnref" as="element(f:ref)" />
  <param name="args"  as="item()*" />

  <f:ref>
    <sequence select="$fnref/@*" />

    <attribute name="partial"
               select="count( $args )" />

    <sequence select="$fnref/*" />
  </f:ref>

  <!-- nested sequences are implicitly flattened, so we're not
       returning a sub-sequence here -->
  <sequence select="$args" />
</function>


<!--
  Determines whether FNREF is a partial application

  You really should not rely on this for your codeâ€”it is intended for
  internal use.  Instead, treat partial applications opaquely as their
  own functions.

<function name="f:is-partial" as="xs:boolean">
  <param name="fnref" as="item()+" />

  <!-- if we're passed a sequence, then the function portion of the
       reference is first; all others are arguments -->
  <variable name="fn"
            select="$fnref[ 1 ]" />

  <!-- we never want to fail, so we perform our type check here rather
       than using param/@as -->
  <sequence select="$fn instance of element(f:ref)
                    and exists( $fn/@partial )
                    and number( $fn/@partial ) gt 0" />
