hoxsl may be used directly from the distribution archive.

To build from source (including a repository checkout), see `Configuring'
below.


Configuring
===========
If your distribution contains a `configure` file in the project root, you
may immediately run `./configure`.

Otherwise, you likely have the sources as they exist in the project
repository, which does not contain the generated `configure` script; you
may generate it by issuing the following command:

  $ autoreconf -fvi

hoxsl has two dependencies, which may be cloned as such:

  $ git clone https://github.com/lovullo/literate-xsl tools/literate-xsl
  $ git clone https://github.com/lovullo/xspec tools/xspec

The latter is required only if running test cases (using `make check').
Once dependencies are in place, simply run:

  $ ./configure


Building
========
After running `configure' above, all necessary runtime files and literate
documentation may be built by running:

  $ make

To build the distribution files, run `make distdir`.  To create the
distribution tarball, run `make dist`.

To run all tests, run `make check`.
